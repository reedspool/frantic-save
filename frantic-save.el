;;; Commentary:
;;
;; frantic-save auto-saves your buffers immediately after each change. It's a
;; more aggressive version of the built-in auto-save-visited-mode or the
;; super-save package's super-save-auto-save-when-idle setting. Both of those
;; wait to save until Emacs is idle, while frantic-save saves regardless of the
;; user's activity.
;;
;; WARNING: frantic-save is currently a Work In Progress, and may make your
;; system unusable in its current state. Probably don't use it.
