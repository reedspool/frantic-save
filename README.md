# `frantic-save` 

Emacs minor mode to save files immediately.

## Usage

Call `M-x frantic-save-activate-this-buffer` to start immediately saving each
change in the current buffer. Then `M-x frantic-save-toggle-selected-buffer`
in the same buffer turns off the behavior. Or again `M-x
frantic-save-toggle-selected-buffer` in a different buffer instead turns that
buffer on for frantic saving.
